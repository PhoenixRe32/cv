\chapter*{Andreas Andreou}
 
  \section*{Senior Consultant}
 
    \subsection*{}
    Andreas has been around in the professional software developing scene since 2014. He started as Java back-end developer but has since then been striving to broaden his skills in as many areas as he can (and finds interesting). He is willing to challenge himself and learn from the people he works with. He is currently interested in improving himself in front end development and CI/CD.

    \subsection*{ThoughtWorks Experience}
      \begin{description}
        \item[\textcolor{gray}{Senior Consultant, Reed Exhibitions, March 2017 - Current}]\textcolor{white}{.}\\
        Andreas worked with the client using \textit{C\#} to modify and update the API to better serve the needs of the user base. In one of the streams he collaborated with the rest of the team to produce a query language for the API using \textit{GraphQL (Javascript)}. The language was developed based on previous experience of the PO with the users and communication with them. Andreas also joined another where he helped develop a basic integration with the main client system to automate the creation of resources using \textit{NodeJS, AWS Lambdas} and \textit{AWS SQS}. Andreas collaborated with the tech lead to map out the requirements and managed the communication and coordination with the developing team of the main system. He also joined the client to an event where he helped showcase a prototype \textit{Android} application and gather feedback.

        Andreas was assigned as a back-end and front-end developer for a bet exchange platform using \textit{Groovy} and \textit{Angular}. He refactored existing code for core functionality to a simple workflow using a modified Chain of Responsibility Pattern that made it easier to debug and understand. He also took part in the planning process with the clients and demoed the product at the end of sprints.
