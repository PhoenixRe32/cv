        \begin{itemize}
          \item I have proposed a webapp project for her to implement in Python using the Flask framework.

          I broke it down to stories and created a kanban board for it.

          We meet every week to discuss the current story.

          Through the stories I teach them developing skills and enrich their Python skills.

          The end target is to give her an idea on what it means to be a developer and how they work so they
          can decide if this is an option they wish to pursue once they finish their Master.
