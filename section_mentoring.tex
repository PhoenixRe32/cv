        \begin{itemize}
          \item I have thought up a webapp project for her to implement in Python using the Flask framework.

          I broke it down to stories and created a kanban board for it.

          We meet every week to discuss the current story.

          Through the stories I teach her developing skills and enrich her Python skills.

          The end target is to give her an idea on what it means to be a developer and how they work so she can decide if this is an option she wishes to pursue once she finishes her Master.

          if so, I am also hoping that this will help her find internships while she is studying.
